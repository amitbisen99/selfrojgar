    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p>By installing or using our app, you agree to these terms, so please read them carefully. You may not duplicate, alter, or use any part of the app, including our branding, in any unauthorized way. Accessing the app’s source code, modifying its features, or creating alternative versions is strictly prohibited. All rights, including intellectual property rights, remain with Self Rojgar App.</p>
    <p>We aim to offer a reliable and valuable app experience. To maintain this, we reserve the right to update the app or introduce paid features at any time. If we do introduce charges, we will always be transparent about what those charges are for.</p>
    <p>The app may collect and process your personal data to deliver our services effectively. It’s important to keep your device and login details secure. We strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as it could expose your device to security risks and prevent the app from functioning properly.</p>

    <h2>Rules for the users</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If you like any item, do not make payment to the other person until the buyer and the seller are satisfied with each other.</li>
        <li>Buyer-Seller should not meet in isolation for any payment. Choose a crowded public place and meet there. Or choose any other convenient/safe place.</li>
        <li>Often the people talking on mobile through a social media community are unknown to each other. Therefore, make any deal very carefully.</li>
        <li>While buying/selling any product, examine/check it thoroughly so that there is no dispute later.</li>
        <li>As far as possible, make online payments instead of cash payments so that you have a record of the same.</li>
        <li>The team of Self Rojgar App will not be responsible for any of your transactions. Because there is no direct communication/transaction between the app company and any user/buyer-seller and neither has any such user been tested by the app company. So be careful.</li>
        <li>From the security point of view, no user should upload any of their documents on the app for a job. If any company asks you to show your documents, show them your documents only after verifying their authenticity.</li>
        <li>Every user connected to this app is expected to follow the guidelines of the Government of India and not cause any harm to any other user in any way.</li>
        <li>As far as possible, users should not enter their private mobile number on the app. For this, enter some other mobile number of your office/shop/firm so that other users can contact on that mobile number only.</li>
        <li>Every user who has entered his/her details in any category on the app, his/her mobile number and other details will be available for viewing by every other user. Therefore, whatever information is displayed on the app, you agree to display it. This will be considered as the consent of the user. (However, the mobile number is kept hidden. It will be displayed when a call is made. And only the information that the user wants to show will be displayed.)</li>
        <li>Users should not be registered on the app if they are involved in any business which is illegal or violates government rules. If found guilty, the app company reserves the right to delete it.</li>
        <li>In case of any kind of cyber fraud, inform them immediately using 1950.</li>
    </ol>
